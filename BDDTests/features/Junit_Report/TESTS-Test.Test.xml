  Scenario: Check the list of tables exists between Ingest Exposure
    Given I set up the database connections for "Ingest" on "CCDEV" environment ... skipped in 0.000s
    And I set up the database connections for "Exposure" on "CCDEV" environment ... skipped in 0.000s
    When I execute following query for "source" Schema ... skipped in 0.000s
      """
      select * from demo.Ing_ChemProc
      """
    When I execute following query for "target" Schema ... skipped in 0.000s
      """
      select * from demo.Exp_Chem
      """
    Then I should get the difference from "Source" to "Target" in "Test_Ingest_Exposure" csv file ... skipped in 0.000s
    And I should get the difference from "Target" to "Source" in "Test_Exposure_Ingest" csv file ... skipped in 0.000s
